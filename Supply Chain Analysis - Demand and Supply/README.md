# Supply Chain Analysis - Demand and Supply

The aim is to calculate the elasticity between supply and demand to understand their correlation.

The elasticity of demand with respect to the number of active drivers per hour: **0.82**

This indicates a moderately responsive relationship between the demand for rides and the number of active drivers per hour. Specifically, a 1% increase in the number of active drivers per hour results in a 0.82% decrease in the demand for rides, while a 1% decrease in active drivers leads to a 0.82% increase in ride demand. This level of elasticity suggests that ride demand is somewhat sensitive to fluctuations in the number of active drivers per hour.
