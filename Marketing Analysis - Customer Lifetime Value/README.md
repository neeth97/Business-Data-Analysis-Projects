# Marketing Analysis - Customer Lifetime Value

Our goal is to calculate the customer lifetime value, identify the most effective marketing channels and campaigns for acquiring high-value customers, and develop targeted retention strategies to keep those customers engaged and loyal.

- So paid advertisement is the most expensive channel, and email marketing is the least expensive channel.
- Social media is the most effective channel for converting customers, while paid advertising is the least effective.
