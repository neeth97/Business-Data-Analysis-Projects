# Marketing Analysis - Customer Lifetime Value

The aim is to calculate the customer lifetime value, identify the most effective marketing channels and campaigns for acquiring high-value customers, and develop targeted retention strategies to keep those customers engaged and loyal.

**We first calculate the customer acquisition cost per channel.**

Paid advertisement is the most expensive channel, and email marketing is the least expensive channel.

**Then we calculate the conversion rate per channel**

Social media is the most effective channel for converting customers, while paid advertising is the least effective.

**Revenue**

We observe that the revenues are fairly equal for all marketing channels.

**Return on Investment per channel**

Email marketing is the most effective in revenue generation and paid advertising is the least effective.

**Customer Lifetime Value**

CLTV=(Revenue−Cost)/Cost × Conversion Rate

Customer Lifetime Value from the Social Media channel is the highest and it is slightly better than the referral channel.
