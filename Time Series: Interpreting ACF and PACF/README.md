We look at Ice Cream sales data.

An ACF measures and plots the average correlation between data points in time series and previous series values measured for different lag lengths. A PACF is similar to an ACF except that each partial correlation controls for any correlation between observations of a shorter lag length.

We aim to determine whether it is an Auto-Regressive (AR) or Moving Average (MA) model.
